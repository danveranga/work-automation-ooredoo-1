# Work Automation â€” Ooredoo (updated as of 02-September-2023)

---

### Introduction

As you may have known, automation has been a trend for the past years and blah blah blah. The point is that technology is continously evolving and I believe that we should adapt to it, unless we want to be stucked with zero progress.

> _But enough with the drama. :)_

This repository is created for the purpose of maintaining and possibly for continuous development of this "ğŸ’©" if it happens to become a something ;) (you know what i'm talking about).

### Here's a little bit of explanation...

This cli app (not really it's just a bunch of logically interconnected scripts) contains **5** main script command / functionality which is used to the so called "automation" process of the workflow. So in short, you cannot fully understand this "ğŸ’©" if you don't know the process of the workflow.

Before I go deeper into the oblivion, I must mention that this is work related ğŸ˜’... so I think you understand why some of my ğŸ§  screws are loosed.

I developed this to make things a little more complicated at first, but then easy, organized, efficient, simple, and fast in the long run.

That's it.
